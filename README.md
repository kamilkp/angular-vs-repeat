Virtual Scroll for AngularJS ngRepeat directive

Demo: http://kamilkp.github.io/angular-vs-repeat/

You can find the source code for this demo on branch "gh-pages".

Changelog: https://github.com/kamilkp/angular-vs-repeat/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

###DESCRIPTION:
`vsRepeat` directive stands for **Virtual Scroll Repeat**. It turns a standard ngRepeated set of elements in a scrollable container
into a component, where the user thinks he has all the elements rendered and all he needs to do is scroll (without any kind of
pagination - which most users loath) and at the same time the browser isn't overloaded by that many elements/angular bindings etc.
The directive renders only so many elements that can fit into current container's `clientHeight`/`clientWidth`.

###LIMITATIONS:
- current version only supports an Array as a right-hand-side object for `ngRepeat`
- all rendered elements must have the same height/width or the sizes of the elements must be known up front

###USAGE:
First include `vs-repeat` as a module dependency in your app.
In order to use the vsRepeat directive you need to place a vs-repeat attribute on a direct parent of an element with ng-repeat
example:

```html
<div vs-repeat>
	<div ng-repeat="item in someArray">
		<!-- content -->
	</div>
</div>
```

You can also measure the single element's height/width (including all paddings and margins), and then speficy it as a value
of the attribute 'vs-repeat'. This can be used if one wants to override the automatically computed element size.
example:

```html
<div vs-repeat="50">	<!-- the specified element height is 50px -->
	<div ng-repeat="item in someArray">
		<!-- content -->
	</div>
</div>
```

- the vsRepeat directive must be applied to a direct parent of an element with `ngRepeat`
- the value of vsRepeat attribute is the single element's height/width measured in pixels. If none provided, the directive will compute it automatically
	

###OPTIONAL PARAMETERS (attributes):
- `vs-scroll-parent="selector"` - selector to the scrollable container. The directive will look for a closest parent matching the given selector (defaults to the current element)
- `vs-offset-before="value"` - top/left offset in pixels (defaults to 0)
- `vs-offset-after="value"` - bottom/right offset in pixels (defaults to 0)
- `vs-horizontal` - horizontal mode (the ngRepeat'ed elements should be horizontally stacked)
- `vs-excess="value"` - an integer number representing the number of elements to be rendered outside of the current container's viewport (defaults to 2)
- `vs-size-property="propertyName"` - a property name of the items in collection that is a number denoting the element size (in pixels)
- `vs-autoresize` - use this attribute without `vs-size-property` and without specifying element's size. The automatically computed element style will readjust upon window resize if the size is dependable on the viewport size

###EVENTS:
- `vsRepeatTrigger` - an event the directive listens for to manually trigger reinitialization
- `vsRepeatReinitialized` - an event the directive emits upon reinitialization done
