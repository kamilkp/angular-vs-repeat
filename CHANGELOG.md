  * bugfix

Version 1.1.0 (2015/12/04)
=================

  * **breaking change** - the funcitonality implemented in https://github.com/kamilkp/angular-vs-repeat/pull/32 has been removed. It appears it can be implemented independently of vs-repeat and was causing the minified js file to be 50% larger.

=================

  * support for ng-repeat-start/ng-repeat-end

=================

### Major changes
  * elements are no longer absolutely positioned
  * no need for a mousewheel helper dummy element on MacOS (to preserve inertia scrolling)
  * no need for `top` updating directives - even better performance

Version 1.0.0-rc12 (2015/08/03)
=================

  * general improvements

Version 1.0.0-rc11 (2015/06/05)
=================

  * important bugfix

Version 1.0.0-rc10 (2015/06/03)
=================

  * You can now specify an attribute `vs-options="{latch: true}"` to enable latching mode - elements once rendered are not being removed when scrolled away (improves scrolling performance when the rendering of each element is time consuming)
  * bugfixes

=================

bugfixes

Version 1.0.0-rc6 (2014/09/29)
=================

### FEATURES
  * added support for resizing items by changing the item size property and then `$broadcasting()`ing the ``vsRepeatTrigger`` event.

Version 1.0.0-rc5 (2014/08/01)
=================

### FEATURES
  * added an optional `vs-autoresize` attribute. You can use it without `vs-size-property` and without specifying element's size. The automatically computed element style will readjust upon window resize if the size is dependable on the viewport size.

Version 1.0.0-rc4 (2014/07/15)
=================

### FEATURES
  * added support for filters in the `ngRepeat` expression
  * added support for variable items sizes (if they are known up front)

Version 1.0.0-rc3 (2014/06/24)
=================
Fixed a bug on Safari and optimized layout recalculations

Version 1.0.0-rc2 (2014/06/09)
=================
Semver compatible version name

Version 1.0.0rc1 (2014/06/02)
=================

### FEATURES
- added travis-ci integration
- added unit tests
- added minified version of the library
- fixed some minor bugs
- updated the [DEMO](http://kamilkp.github.io/angular-vs-repeat/) that now also address the performance benefits of using the library

Version 0.3 (2014/05/30)
=================

### FEATURES
- support for automatic computation of repeated elements' `height`/`width`

### BREAKING CHANGE:
- specifying the single element's size as a value of the `vs-repeat` attribute is no longer required. If it isn't provided the directive will calculate it automatically (once, the first time it renders at least one element). If for some reason you want to override that size, you can still provide is as a value of the `vs-repeat` attribute.

Version 0.2 (2014/05/25)
=================

### FEATURES
- support for horizontally stacked elements (a `vs-horizontal` attribute must be placed on the element)
- no need to use jQuery, `vsRepeat` can now work with angular (jqLite) only
- support for before/after offsets (in pixels) via `vs-offset-before` and `vs-offset-after`
- full support for nested `vsRepeat`s and scrolling in both directions even within the same container

### BREAKING CHANGE:
- `vs-top-offset` attribute is now called `vs-offset-before`

Version 0.1
=================

### FEATURES
- support for vertically stacked elements
